Technology Stack
React and TypeScript: For building a dynamic and robust front-end.

Electron: To run the application as a cross-platform desktop app.

react-router-dom: Manages in-app navigation.

Custom Electron API: Provides functions for loading/saving settings and managing note operations.

Electron API Integration
The app uses a custom Electron API, which is made available on the global window object as window.electronAPI. This API handles:

Settings:
Loading and saving user configuration.

Note Operations:
Creating new notes, fetching existing notes, loading individual notes, saving changes, and deleting notes.

If the Electron API is not detected, the application displays an error message and prevents further data loading to ensure stability.
